Fraud Detection Dashboard & Model Analysis — Real-World Simulation Project

Over the past few days, I worked on building a Fraud Investigation Dashboard designed to analyze millions of transactions and identify patterns of fraudulent behavior using both rule-based and machine learning models.

🔍 Project Highlights:

Processed over 6.3M transactions with a fraud rate of only 0.13%

Identified top fraud types — ‘CASH_OUT’ and ‘TRANSFER’ — accounting for most fraudulent activity

Used Logistic Regression and Random Forest to predict fraud probability

Achieved precision of 0.96 and recall of 0.78 with Random Forest, showing strong capability in fraud detection without overfitting

📊 Key Insights:
1️⃣ Most frauds occur in TRANSFER and CASH_OUT transactions
2️⃣ High-value transactions with insufficient balances show higher risk
3️⃣ Fraud tends to spike around specific time intervals
4️⃣ Rule-based checks work well but machine learning provides stronger adaptability
